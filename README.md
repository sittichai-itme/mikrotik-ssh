# mikrotik-ssh
using ssh command for mikrotik multi routers

I am a lazy person and this code was created during work to help speed up the process. Its principle is simple
Create files .txt in root part of script
1. config.txt is used to store commands.
2. router.txt contains the IP addresses of the routers.
3. login.txt holds the user passwords and ports.
After running the program, it will generate a result.txt file to record what has been done.
